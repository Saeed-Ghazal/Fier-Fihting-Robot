### Fire-Fighting Robot Project

This is a Fire-Fighting Robot designed for the Fire Fighting Robot Contest (FFRC).  
It can detect and extinguish small fires and collect balls using a suction mechanism.  
The robot is controlled via an ESP32 microcontroller and has a dual-mode operation: manual for initial regions and autonomous in the final region.
